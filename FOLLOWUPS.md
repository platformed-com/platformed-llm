# Follow-ups

Tracked work deferred from the testability + bug-fix sweep that finished in
the cae938b…HEAD range. Items here are intentionally skipped, not forgotten.
Delete sections as they land.

## Phase 1.6 — Vertex multi-region host patterns

`src/providers/vertex/transport.rs::default_host` already special-cases
`location == "global"` (uses the unprefixed `aiplatform.googleapis.com`).
Multi-region aliases (`us`, `eu`) currently fall through to the regional
pattern and produce hosts like `us-aiplatform.googleapis.com`, which
likely don't resolve. Vertex docs suggest the correct pattern is
`aiplatform.{us,eu}.rep.googleapis.com`.

**Plan**:
1. Verify the exact host pattern against current Vertex AI docs (or hit
   it from a project that has multi-region routing enabled).
2. Extend `default_host` with `match location { "us" | "eu" => …, "global"
   => …, regional => … }`.
3. Add parametric tests in `transport::tests` covering each branch.

## Phase 5 — breaking API redesign

These each touch every consumer of the crate, so they deserve their own
dedicated commit/PR rather than being mixed into bug fixes.

### Vec<ContentPart> message model

The single biggest gap. `Message::content: String` and `OutputItem::Text`
can't represent:
- Multi-modal (images / audio in user messages).
- Reasoning blocks with `signature` (Anthropic). Currently
  `OutputItem::Reasoning { content, signature }` carries the signature,
  but `OutputItem::to_input_item` drops it on the way back into a
  request — so multi-turn thinking can't actually round-trip.
- Anthropic `redacted_thinking` blocks (opaque blob; pass-through only).
- Mixed text + tool_use within a single assistant turn (we currently
  split them into separate `InputItem`s, which loses ordering when
  reading back).

**Plan**:
```rust
pub enum ContentPart {
    Text(String),
    Image { source: ImageSource },
    Reasoning { content: String, signature: Option<String> },
    RedactedReasoning { data: String },
}

pub struct Message {
    pub role: Role,
    pub content: Vec<ContentPart>,
}

pub enum OutputItem {
    Message { content: Vec<ContentPart> },
    FunctionCall { call: FunctionCall },
}
```

Each provider's `convert_request` walks parts and emits the right wire
shape; the accumulator coalesces adjacent text deltas into a single
`ContentPart::Text`. Anthropic's signature now round-trips correctly.

### Error redesign

Currently `Error::Provider { provider, message }` swallows the HTTP
status and the structured provider error body, and `Error::Auth(String)`
/ `Error::Streaming(String)` are stringly typed. After the OpenAI
typed-error work in Phase 2.6, the variant shapes are inconsistent
across providers.

**Plan**:
```rust
pub enum Error {
    Auth { provider: ProviderType, status: Option<u16>, message: String },
    InvalidRequest { status: u16, message: String, body: Option<Box<RawValue>> },
    RateLimit { status: u16, retry_after: Option<Duration>, message: String },
    Provider { status: u16, retryable: bool, message: String, body: Option<Box<RawValue>> },
    Streaming { source: Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync> },
    Transport(reqwest::Error),
    Serialization(serde_json::Error),
    Cancelled,
}
```

All three provider error mappers route into these variants; consumers
get `retry_after` / `retryable` for free.

### Response::collect()

`Response::text()` and `Response::buffer()` each consume the response
once, so callers who want both the streamed events AND the final
buffered text have to call `provider.generate(...)` twice. The examples
work around this exact problem.

**Plan**: add `Response::collect() -> Result<(Vec<StreamEvent>,
CompleteResponse), Error>` that returns both. Deprecate `text()` if
collect makes it redundant.

### Drop `pub use providers::*; pub use types::*;` globs

`src/lib.rs:20-23`. Glob re-exports make the public API surface
implicit and turn an accidentally-leaked `pub(crate)` helper into a
breaking change. Replace with explicit re-exports of named items.

### `from_env()` simplification

`src/factory.rs::ProviderConfig::from_env` has ~60 lines of
credential-sniffing fallbacks that try to guess the provider type from
which env var happens to be set. Drop the fallback; require
`PROVIDER_TYPE` to be set explicitly. Document the four envs each
provider reads.

## Reasoning / thinking gaps

Mostly blocked on the `Vec<ContentPart>` redesign above:

- `OutputItem::Reasoning::to_input_item` drops the content + signature
  on round-trip. Once messages carry parts, fold reasoning back into the
  assistant message so multi-turn extended thinking works.
- Anthropic `redacted_thinking` blocks are parsed but discarded. They
  must be echoed back unchanged to preserve continuity for sensitive
  thinking turns.
- Gemini request-side `generationConfig.thinkingConfig` is **not** wired.
  Phase 3.5 added response-side `thoughtsTokenCount` parsing; the
  request-side budget setting (so callers can ask Gemini 2.5 to think)
  still needs `thinkingConfig: { thinking_budget: N }` on the
  `GoogleGenerationConfig`.

## Unwired request fields

These reach `LLMRequest` but no provider serializes them:

- `LLMRequest::stop` — Gemini's `stopSequences`, OpenAI's `stop`,
  Anthropic's `stop_sequences`. None of the three providers thread it
  through.
- `LLMRequest::presence_penalty` / `frequency_penalty` — supported by
  OpenAI (non-reasoning models) and Gemini, ignored today.

Easy fix once decided whether to wire them or remove them from
`LLMRequest` (Phase 5's API redesign is a natural moment to decide).

## Other provider feature gaps

- **OpenAI refusal handling**: `response.refusal.delta` / `.done` events
  are silently dropped. Should surface as a typed `StreamEvent::Refusal`
  (or fold into `Error::ContentFilter`).
- **OpenAI `response.failed` / `response.incomplete`**: not handled,
  which means `FinishReason::ContentFilter` / `Length` are unreachable
  via OpenAI today. The dispatcher needs `incomplete_details.reason`
  mapping.
- **OpenAI `OpenAI-Organization` / `OpenAI-Project` headers**: optional,
  but multi-org / project-scoped keys won't work without them.
- **Anthropic `cache_control: Ephemeral`** on tools / system / message
  blocks: prompt caching gate. Big cost lever.
- **Anthropic `anthropic-beta` headers**: required for several beta
  features (computer use, fine-grained tool streaming).
- **Gemini `toolConfig`**: forced tool mode (`AUTO` / `ANY` / `NONE`)
  isn't exposed. The `ToolChoice` enum on `LLMRequest` is wired only on
  OpenAI; Anthropic and Gemini still ignore it.
- **Gemini structured output**: `responseMimeType` /
  `responseSchema` (JSON mode equivalent) — no surface.

## Testing gaps

- **Trace capture system is in place** (`cargo run --example
  capture_traces`) but no traces have been committed yet. The first run
  of the binary against a real account will populate
  `tests/cross_provider/traces/` and unlock `cargo test --test
  replay_traces` as a meaningful regression check. Until then the
  replay test no-ops.
- **OpenAI HTTP error mapping is unit-tested but not e2e-tested.**
  `parse_openai_error` has unit tests for 401/429/500; the wiremock
  cross-provider suite never asserts that a 429 surfaces as
  `Error::RateLimit` end-to-end through `generate()`. Easy to add
  alongside the trace-driven tests.
- **No tests for cancellation.** Dropping a `Response` mid-stream
  should abort the underlying request. Behaviour is unverified.
- **No property/fuzz tests on the SSE parser.** Worth adding
  proptest-style tests that feed arbitrary chunk boundaries through
  the parser and verify event ordering is invariant.
- **Snapshot-style tests on the unified event stream.** A trace
  replayed through the parser produces a deterministic sequence of
  unified events. Snapshotting that sequence (via `insta` or similar)
  would make wire-shape regressions trivial to review as a PR diff.
- **No error-path captures.** The capture tool currently only handles
  the success path. Worth extending it to capture deliberately failing
  requests (bad key → 401, malformed body → 400, etc.) so the typed
  error mapping has real-world data to verify against.
