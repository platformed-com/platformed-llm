Create a model response
post https://api.openai.com/v1/responses

Creates a model response. Provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs. Have the model call your own custom code or use built-in tools like web search or file search to use your own data as input for the model's response.
Request body
background

boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to false

Whether to run the model response in the background. Learn more.
include

array or null
Optional

Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

    code_interpreter_call.outputs: Includes the outputs of python code execution in code interpreter tool call items.
    computer_call_output.output.image_url: Include image urls from the computer call output.
    file_search_call.results: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
    message.input_image.image_url: Include image urls from the input message.
    message.output_text.logprobs: Include logprobs with assistant messages.
    reasoning.encrypted_content: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning tokens in reasoning item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in multi-turn conversations when using the Responses API statelessly (like when the store parameter is set to false, or when an organization is enrolled in the zero data retention program).

input

string or array
Optional

Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

    Text inputs and outputs
    Image inputs
    File inputs
    Conversation state
    Function calling

instructions

string or null
Optional

A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.
max_output_tokens

integer or null
Optional

An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.
max_tool_calls

integer or null
Optional

The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.
metadata

map
Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.
model

string
Optional

Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.
parallel_tool_calls

boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to true

Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.
previous_response_id

string or null
Optional

The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.
prompt

object or null
Optional

Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.
reasoning

object or null
Optional

o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.
service_tier

string or null
Optional
Defaults to auto

Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

    If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
    If set to 'default', then the request will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
    If set to 'flex' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier. Contact sales to learn more about Priority processing.
    When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When the service_tier parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.
store

boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to true

Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.
stream

boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to false

If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.
temperature

number or null
Optional
Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
text

object
Optional

Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

    Text inputs and outputs
    Structured Outputs

tool_choice

string or object
Optional

How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.
tools

array
Optional

An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

    Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
    Function calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code. Learn more about function calling.

top_logprobs

integer or null
Optional

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
top_p

number or null
Optional
Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
truncation

string or null
Optional
Defaults to disabled

The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

    auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
    disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.

user

string
Optional

A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. Learn more.
Returns

Returns a Response object.
